"Hey, buddy, look at my blog. Awesome. Right? "

Hahahahahaha......



But I didn't know this costs me so much.

# What am I going to do with this blog?


1.The theme of the blog should keep updated with the current technology. So, this theme maybe changes a lot or add some useless stuff(I hope it could be useful:D )

2.My blog's name is **go deep**. So I definitely pay attention to the quality of my articles in my blog. Perhaps some articles looks too easy for you since I am not good at everything what you guys excel at. So, be lenient. Thanks.

But,

I make sure that I will do my best to write all posts.

Sometimes, it happens to me that some posts are **totally useless** especially in China while I have already spent a lot of time in that. Damn!!!

So, the summary is:


> **QUALITIES OF POSTS FIRSTS! DEFINITELY!**

# Gossips

Why did I say this theme costs me a lot?

Because [next-geek][] is created in January, 2017. Mountains of stuff is killing me, which is main reason I didn't do it so quickly.

When I went to [isitmaintained][] to check my repository, I was surprised by the statistical data. DAMN. 103d for only 1 issue.

I have been fixing this theme for this recent two weeks.
Okay, it is encourageing that [next-geek][] is getting better. (So I can show off, Hahaha)

The issues of my blog should get fixed later since a lot of troublesome trivial matters are killing me again. I can't get affected by these.


And also, I bought three-year domain.(Damn, it costs me 191ï¿¥ = 27$) Come on. I am still a poor student. That's expensive to me.

Fine, I hope blog derserve this.

# Future Plan

**1.Master Degreen First**

Some people may ask: Why don't you just go to work?

Yeah, probably. But my educational background could look better.

Why need higher degree? Any reasons?

:) Nuh. I have decided to have one master degree. THere's no special reasons for this. That's all.



**2.Professional Skills Second**

I have to earn to live, right? So, I need my professional skill prepared in the future. Or what difference between me and `salty fish`(Okay, this is a joke in China. Salty fish means man who doesn't have any dreams.)

Also,

> Men must have dreams. Even you have already become one of salty fish, then be the most salty one.

**3.Front-end Knowledge, such CSS, HTML, Javascript**


This is for showing off my blog. :D



**4.C++ or Java?**

Unfortunately, I can do C++ and Java both.

This is a little troublesome bacause I only have to choose one to expel at.

However, I am young now that I wanna be the best in Java and C++.

C++ is main coding language, with assistant by Kotlin( Java just backs up )



**5.Keep multi-language version of posts**


I can only speak in Chinese(native), English and Japanese. I will try to write muti-language version of posts to you.

Why I do this? Anyway, noone visits your blog.

:D I don't care. I am just for myself and for practicing.

Maybe I will add Korean later~

Just Looking Forword.
