    Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br/>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

    Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br/>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

    <p class="intro">Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br/>
    Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br/>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

    Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br/>
    Do not go gentle into that good night.<br/>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
